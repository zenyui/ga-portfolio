GA Final Project Repo

<strong>What is the question you hope to answer?</strong>
I'm going to predict if a customer is likely to return again in 90 days given various attributes about their shopping experience.

<strong>What data are you planning to use to answer that question?</strong>
I am using our retail/QSR POS data, and I will be defining customers using the last 4 digits of their credit card and their last name.

<strong>What do you know about the data so far?</strong>
- I know I have many repeat customers
- I know I don't have missing data, as the fields I'm using are required by the software
- I know I can add and create features very easily
- I know my repeat customers are (mostly) not employees, as I removed all tickets with an employee discount to prevent unwanted positives

<strong>Why did you choose this topic?</strong>
It's relevant to my work, and it's something that (until now) Eataly has not been able to properly analyze or understand.  I'm genuinely curious to see what the project teaches me about our customers, and I know my boss will appreciate this ROI in my education.
